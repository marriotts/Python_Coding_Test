File Searching (7 hours).

    Scenario

You have a big directory tree with many files in it. Some of the files have
".inform" suffixes.  Some of the files contain instances of the string "port
#nnnn", where nnnn is a hexadecimal number of some length.

    F1) Core Task

Searching only the files with .inform suffix, count the number of instances
of each different "port #nnnn" string, where nnnn is a four or more digit
hexadecimal number to a maximum of 32 digits, and output a table of port
number against occurrence frequency.

Make sure that each file (piece of data on disk) is only scanned once, and
that the strings in it are only counted once.

Example Output

Port frq
0000  1
1384  5
28f6  1
44ff  7

Do *not* use the PERL File::Find module in your solution, or any similar
module which does all the work for you.

Document any assumptions that you make about the task. Note that assumptions
may be made at any stage.

    F2) Non-cyclic links

     For extra credit, modify your program to deal with directory structures
that contain links, such that there may be more than one path from the root
to a given .inform file. Assume that the links do not loop.

    F3) Cyclic links

    For even more credit, deal with links that form loops.

    F4) Extra credit (Optional)

    Provide an additional solution which does not use recursion.

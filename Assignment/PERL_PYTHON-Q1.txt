Regular Expression Warmup (<1hour).

Present the solution for each task as a procedure which takes a
candidate string and prints either "MATCH: " followed by the string
that was matched, or "NO MATCH" if the test data was not matched.

Also include in your script all your test data, and a procedure that
will run all the solutions against the relevant test data, announcing
each of the solutions before they are tested.

Eg:

 Solution 1:
 ABC
 MATCH: ABC
 AABCC
 MATCH: ABC
 AAAC
 NO MATCH

 Solution 2:
 ...

Extra credit given for clarity and brevity.

   W1) Write a regexp that only matches the string (wherever it

   W2) Write a single regexp that matches any of the strings below,and

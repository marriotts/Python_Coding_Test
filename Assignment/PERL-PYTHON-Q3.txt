ISO 8601 Date Parser (unspecified time)
=======================================

This assignment may be more complex than it looks. Take care.

Write a parser which will accept any date/time conforming to the ISO 8601
standard and print a breakdown of the century, year, month, day, hour, minute,
second and millisecond specified by that time, indicating if any component
is undefined.

For example, for the input "2007-06-02" it would print:

Century: 21
Year: 2007
Month: 06
Day: 02
Hour: undefined
Minute: undefined
Second: undefined
Millisecond: undefined

Document any assumptions you make about the input, and any omissions (valid
ISO 8601 formats that your parser does not handle).

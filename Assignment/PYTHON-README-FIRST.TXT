PYTHON is in heavy use for test. If you don't know it, you should be
able to learn it to the required (basic) level within 2 days.  This can be
part of the task, to test speed of adaption. If you have to learn PYTHON to do
this assignment, we will take that into account when we assess your
submission.

Please complete the following tasks using PYTHON 3.5 or higher. If you don't
know PYTHON teach yourself enough of it to complete the tasks.

Each exercise has a suggested maximum time associated with it. This is the
longest that we would expect a fairly competent and reasonably experienced
coder to spend on that task. If you're learning PYTHON as you go, multiply
these times by at least 2. If you're learning progaramming as you go,
multiply these times by at least another 4, and you may want to do some
other tutorials before you attempt the more advanced tasks (such as the file
search). If you find that you haven't completed a section within the
suggested time, please feel free to make some notes and move on.

Your solution should be an archive containing a runnable script for
each of the exercises, whatever test data that you used, and text file
detailing any assumptions made. The quality of your code will be judged
on correctness, maintainability, and robustness. Performance should be
adequate (and won't be an issue if you avoid gross inefficencies).

We realise that you may be very busy. Please don't spend any more time on
this than you are happy to spend. If you know that you are going to want
more time for the assignment than you have been offered, please explain your
reasons and ask for an extension. If, for whatever reason, you don't
complete any part of the assignment, please make some notes about how you
would go about the aspects or tasks that you didn't complete.

If you have any questions please get in touch and ask them.

Please send us your work within a week or receiving the test.
